# Getting To Space

![SpaceShip](/img/1861.jpg)

Space exploration is an ongoing effort to find out what lies beyond the Earth. Human space travel has been a dream for many people since the dawn of space technology. The success of each space flight inspires hope that one day, humans will walk on other planets. The history of space travel is thrilling in its own right and has a lot to teach us about the future of technology and human existence.
The first man to venture into space was Yuri Gagarin. He became the first human to enter Earth's atmosphere in 1961 during a mission in Russia's Vostok spacecraft. Other countries soon followed suit with their own space programs. These early space missions were conducted mainly by Russia and the United States, and they helped define the future of human exploration. Many more countries are now engaged in space exploration, with China, France, India and Japan also having their own programs.
NASA's Jupiter orbit mission proved that humans could survive in space for prolonged periods. This was the first time an astronaut walked on the moon. Later, astronauts also set foot on Mars during a Mars mission. Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin joined his fellow crew members on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. After this historic voyage, 23 new countries declared their intention to pursue space exploration programs. The Cold War was drawing to a close as well, which allowed for even more international cooperation in space exploration.

The first human in space was Yuri Gagarin; he became the first person to orbit the Earth during a cosmodrome launch in April 1969. His fellow crew members - Vladimir Komarov and Vaslav Nijinsky - were also aboard the spacecraft at the time of launch. Gagarin's backup was selected last minute and declined to participate; this left him as the only cosmonaut without a crew member on the ground. This 'ground-man' functioned as an escape route and backup communication system for the astronauts in case of emergency. As we all know well by now, Gagarin returned safely after his singleorbit around the Earth.

Komarov also made it into space but did not make it back to his ship after he ejected from his Soyuz 2-1b spacecraft during a ballistic trajectory test on April 24th, 1963. This is known as 'the fatal flight.' His fatal flight ended with his death when he failed to recover from a spin and fell into Siberia's Lake Baikal near Bolshoy Ivanov Island. Later analysis showed that he may have ejected from his spacecraft too late after running into problems with his ejection system due to heavy cloud cover. His death remains shrouded in mystery today but has given rise to much speculation among fans of Russian lore and sci-fi films alike.

The next person to go into space was Yuri Gagarin alongside cosmonauts GA Leonov and Pyotr Kolodyevskyy during the Vostok 1 mission on April 12th, 1961. Gagarin became the first person ever to orbited Earth while standing on another planet - Venus - during another cosmodrome launch five months later. His crew mates also included NASA astronaut Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin during mankind's first manned landing on another planet - Mars - seven months later during mankind's second manned landing on Mars - July 21st- 23rd, 1962 during mankind's third manned landing on Mars - November 17th-18th, 1963 during mankind's fourth manned landing on Mars - July 6th-9th, 1965 during mankind's fifth manned landing on Mars - January 3rd-6th, 1967 during mankind's sixth manned landing on Mars - November 3rd-6th, 1969 during mankind's seventh manned landing on Mars - February 21st-23rd, 1971 during mankind's eighth manned landing on Mars - November 4th-6th, 1971 during mankind's ninth manned landing on Mars - August 6th-8th, 1973 during mankind's tenth manned landing on Mars - November
